- first building it in mobile view, not responsive at all
  - show diff b/w inline and block elements
- responsive things to fix
  - input bar
    - width increases from 0 to 743px -> max-width or percentage
      - show percentage first but show that for large screen wouldn't be good
        - but for airbnb it would be fine b/c they refresh the ui after 743px width
      - then show how max-width would help
  - footer sections -> media query, flex, & width of each column as percentage
    - first do media query & flex jcspb, then show the effect of width
  - footer very bottom section -> changing flex direction
    - ignore social media buttons until (3)
    - 1. do terms part
      - use :after to do the bullets for the terms and realize afterwards that you will want flex so the items wrap nicely like Airbnb's
    - 2. do spacing
      - middle size starts at 744px
        - social media buttons appear
        - content is centered
      - big size starts at 1128px
        - 2nd and 3rd item get grouped to the left
        - 1st item goes to the right
    - 3. add in social media buttons
  - cards grid
    - show flex first and limited b/c one card looks bad for large screen that can only still fit one card
    - this is a case for grid being better, because there's an easier solution for this
  - grid challenge -> footer suggestions
  - header / top section - changes a lot after 743px
    - challenge or do?
    - maybe challenge then do in a follow-up video?
    - observations
      -
