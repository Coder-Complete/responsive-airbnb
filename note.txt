- first building it in mobile view, not responsive at all
  - show diff b/w inline and block elements
- responsive things to fix
  - footer sections -> media query, flex, & width of each column as percentage
    - first do media query & flex jcspb, then show the effect of width
  - footer very bottom section -> changing flex direction
    - also, use :after to do the bullets for the terms and realize afterwards that you will want flex so the items wrap nicely like Airbnb's
    - start by ignoring social media buttons
    - then add them after
    - middle size starts at 744px
      - social media buttons appear
      - content is centered
    - big size starts at 1128px
      - 2nd and 3rd item get grouped to the left
      - 1st item goes to the right
  - cards grid
    - show flex first and limited b/c one card looks bad for large screen that can only still fit one card
    - this is a case for grid being better, because there's an easier solution for this
  - grid challenge -> footer suggestions
  - input bar
    - width increases from 0 to 743px -> max-width
  - nav
    - 744px width and after, ui changes significantly -> media queries & js
