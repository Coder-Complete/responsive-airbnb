- first building it in mobile view, not responsive at all
  - show diff b/w inline and block elements
- responsive things to fix
  - spacing in general -> flex
  - input bar
    - width increases from 0 to 743px -> max-width
    - 744px width and after, ui changes significantly -> media queries & js
  - nav
    - 744px width and after, ui changes significantly -> media queries & js
  - cards grid
    - show flex first and limited b/c one card looks bad for large screen that can only still fit one card
    - this is a case for grid being better, because there's an easier solution for this
    - would it be possible to do with just flex?
  - footer__suggestions -> flex wrap
  - footer items...
